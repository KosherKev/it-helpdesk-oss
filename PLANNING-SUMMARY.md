## 🎯 Comparison with Network Monitoring OSS

### Why Helpdesk is Better for 3 Weeks

| Aspect | Network Monitoring | Helpdesk System |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|

| **Learning Curve** | Steep (networking concepts) | Gentle (CRUD basics) |
| **Hardware Needed** | Yes (or simulators) | No |
| **Demo Difficulty** | Hard (need equipment) | Easy (laptop only) |
| **3-Week Feasible** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
